# It's 2003 and you just won a game of solitaire

It's 8:24 PM. You're sitting at the living room computer, an old Compaq running Windows 98. You should be writing your essay for school, but you're playing solitaire.

## Features
* Boot screen and sound!
* Runs at a **realistic** and *lifelike* 30 fps!
* Imitates the classic cascading effect from Microsoft Solitaire!
* Cards change their value when hitting the walls!
* Touch and drag the cards! Throw them around!
* Motion controls! Alter the direction of the cards by rotating your phone!
* Heats up your phone! Use it as a hand warmer!

## Stuff I'm Proud Of
* Card textures come from a single image! I do some super cool texture region work to split the image into textures!
* The physics of the cards took a ton of time to get looking close to correct!
* The drag throwing system took a while to get right. Lots of bugs there so I'm glad its super intuitive now!
